# GXT Text replacer
GXT Text replacer for GTA San Andreas.

This tool allows you to replace GXT texts with the texts in UTF-8 text files quickly.

**IMPORTANT: This tool is just a software prototype, especially made for Japanese Kanji Mod.**  
**I'll create more a stable version with an GXT text extracter and a more flexible builder than Silent's GXT Builder.**

## Building

You need Visual Studio 2017 to compile.

## Using

    gxt_text_replacer [GXT filename] [Text folder] [-usecharmap] [-ansitext] [-unicodetext] [-ansicodepage (value)]

## Help

For additional help, use:

    gxtbuilder --help
